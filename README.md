# CovidInMexico
This is my final project from object oriented programming, it was programmed using Java MVC structure.

# To use it:
## It needs an Oracle Database with Covid CSV loaded
### Modify DBconfig file to match your username and password

The CSV is created with a python script with data from the official CDMX Covid Documentation.
